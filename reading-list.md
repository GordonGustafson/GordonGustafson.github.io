Tools
=====

- [*Learning Apache Cassandra*][learning-apache-cassandra]

  A good introduction to Cassandra 2.0.

- [*Mastering Apache Cassandra*][mastering-apache-cassandra]

  While the grammar was atrocious, this filled in a lot of the gaps that *Learning Apache Cassandra* didn't cover.
  The 'Cassandra Architecture' and 'Performance Tuning' chapters were awesome.
  Note that this and *Learning Apache Cassandra* were the only books I could find on Cassandra 2.0 and 2.1 as of June 2015.

- [*Hadoop: The Definitive Guide*][hadoop-the-definitive-guide], 3rd Edition

  A good introduction to Hadoop and the Hadoop ecosystem, thought you'll probably want the 4th edition.

- [*Pro Git*][pro-git]

  After reading the whole thing my git-fu was better than almost all my classmates'.

- [*Version Control with Subversion*][version-control-with-subversion]

  The first four chapters were very useful; I didn't read more because my interactions with svn are infrequent and straightforward (thankfully).

- [*Classic Shell Scripting*][classic-shell-scripting]
- [*Learning The Vi And Vim Editors*][learning-the-vi-and-vim-editors]


Software Engineering
====================

- [*Debugging: The 9 Indispensable Rules for Finding Even the Most Elusive Software and Hardware Problems*][debugging]

  Useful, engaging, and short. I've read it twice.

- [*The Mythical Man Month*][the-mythical-man-month]
- [*Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software*][code-the-hidden-language]

  This was a great introduction to digital logic when I read it in high school.

- [*Code Complete*][code-complete], 2nd Edition and [*The Art of Readable Code*][the-art-of-readable-code]

  If you don't know everything in these books you should read them.

- [*97 Things Every Programmer Should Know*][97-things] and [*Secrets of the Rock Star Programmers*][secrets-of-the-rock-star-programmers]

  I've forgotten if these were any good, but they were less focused on single topics and more conversational.


Languages
=========
- [*Clojure Programming*][clojure-programming]

  An amazing book on an amazing language, this gave me a new perspective on functional programming and concurrency.

- [*Practical Common Lisp*][practical-common-lisp]

  After reading this I no longer feel like a stranger in the Lisp world.

- [*Effective Java*][effective-java], 2nd Edition
- [*JavaScript - The Good Parts*][javascript-the-good-parts]
- [*Javascript: The Definitive Guide*][javascript-the-definitive-guide], 5th Edition
- [*C# in depth*][c#-in-depth], 1st Edition

  The first edition was a good introduction to C#, so I expect the newer editions are as well.

- [*Pro C# 2008 and the .NET 3.5 Platform*][pro-c#-2008]
- [*The C Programming Language*][the-c-programming-language], 2nd Edition (K&R)

  Old, but a very good introduction to C.

- *[comp.lang.c FAQ][C-faq]*

  Lots of useful information in a very dense format, this helped take me from 'using C' to 'knowing C'.

- [*Eloquent Ruby*][eloquent-ruby]
- [*An Introduction to Functional Programming Through Lambda Calculus*][lambda-calculus]

  This book is light on math and won't bore a software engineer.
  Thanks to this book I can bootstrap a language with booleans, positive integers, and lists from lambda calculus at a moment's notice.


Other Technical Topics
======================
- [*Webmaster in a Nutshell*][webmaster-in-a-nutshell], 3rd Edition
- [*Beginning XML*][beginning-xml]


Non-technical
=============
- [*How to Win Friends and Influence People*][how-to-win-friends]

  Worth reading so I never forget rules like "always remember people's names" and "anyone will like you if you just listen."

- [*Ender's Game*][enders-game]
- [*Snow Crash*][snow-crash]

  Amazing worldbuilding, which is the main reason I read it.
  However, the amount of worldbuilding decreases monotonically, and my enjoyment did as well.

- [*Dreaming in Code*][dreaming-in-code]
